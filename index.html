<h3>What is Valorant?</h3>
<p>Valorant is a tactical shooting game involving two teams with 5 
players in each team. Every player can sign in and play remotely from 
anywhere in the world. Every game has 25 rounds and the team that 
wins 13 of them first wins the game. Players can choose their in-game 
characters called agents at the start of the game. Players can buy 
abilities and weapons at the start of the game.</p>
<h3>Can your PC handle it?</h3>
<p>The size of the download file for Valorant is just 7.3GB, which is 
quite small in comparison to the file size of many of the modern day PC 
games. In terms of hardware requirements, minimum specs required 
for gaming at 30 FPS (frames per second) is Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 CPU 
and Intel HD4000 GPU. However, for a enjoyable gaming experience at 
60FPS Riot Games recommends, no less than Intel Core i3-4150 CPU 
and Nvidia GeForce GT 730 GPU. For the best possible experience at 
144 and higher FPS, players should at least have Intel Core i5-4460 
clocking at 3.2GHz and Nvidia GTX 1050Ti.</p>
<h3>How to Play Valorant?</h3>
<p>VALORANTâ€™s classic game mode features two teams of five 
players facing off in rounds with a 30-second buy phase and a 1:40-
minute active phase. The attackers must plant a Spike or eliminate 
every enemy to win, while the defenders must prevent the Spike from 
exploding by eliminating the attackers or defusing the Spike if planted. 
The first team to reach 13 points wins the game.</p>
